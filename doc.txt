timestamp scan uses student club by default instead of getting clubs from student
  prevents changes to timestamp club on previous timesheets if student changes clubs

tag timestamps with the family taht they were signed out with if applicable.
  giving indiecation of IF there was even a family pin used can help with reducing illegitimate signouts
